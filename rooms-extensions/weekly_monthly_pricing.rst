Rooms Periodic Pricing
======================
The Roomify Periodic Pricing module allows you to quickly define nightly, weekly and monthly rates that can change for any given date.

This is a replacement to the rooms_periodic_pricing module contained within Rooms.

Installation
------------
1. De-activate (if active) the rooms_periodic_pricing module.
2. Add the roomify_periodic_pricing module to your sites/all/modules directory (or any other location you are keeping your modules)
3. Activate the module

Configuration & Usage
----------------------
1. Within the edit page of a unit set the Weekly and Monthly Rates. Weekly rates apply for bookings over 7 days and monthly rates apply for bookings over 28 dates. These are the *default* values.

The Price Tester
----------------------
To help identifying what prices will be charged for a given booking period the price tester can be used. It will show prices for all different rates and indicate which one will be used given the dates selected.
