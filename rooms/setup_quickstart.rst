Setup Quickstart
----------------

1. Visit admin/rooms/units/unit-types and create a unit type (e.g. standard double room).

2. Visit admin/rooms/units and create a couple of bookable units.

3. Set availability and pricing - clicking on events or date ranges in the calendars will bring up a pop-up dialog and allow you to interact with them.

4. To manually create a Booking go to admin/rooms/bookings/add. This will also create a Commerce order and line item for that booking.

5. Potential guests can go to booking to do an availability search.
