#. `Manage Properties`_

Create a Property
=================

Creating a property is done from within your dashboard.  If you have permission to add a property, you will see the 'add property' button, as shown in the screenshot below.

Click on 'add property'. You will be asked for the name of the Property, and asked to select the type of property:

   :align: center

+ `Single Unit Property`_

   A single unit property is a property that can only be booked as a whole. The most common type of single unit property is a Vacation Rental.  The rental property may have 1, 2, or even 12 bedrooms, but a booking is made for the whole property.

+ `Multi Unit Property`_


   A multi unit property is a property with multiple individually bookable rooms. Both B & B's and Hotels are multi unit properties.

Single Unit Property
--------------------
To create a single unit property, enter the name of the property, select 'Single Unit (Entire Home)', and click 'next'. You will then be asked to define the maximum number of occupants, and the default nightly rate:

   :align: center

Click on 'Create property and add details' - this will create your property and direct you to the property management interface: `Manage Properties`_

Multi Unit Property
-------------------

To create a multi unit property, enter the name of the property, select 'Multi-Unit (multiple rooms / types within a property)', and click 'next'.

.. image:: images/multi_unit_1.png
   :width: 700 px
   :align: center

You will be asked to enter the type name, number of rooms, default price per night, and max occupancy, for each of your room types.  If you have a B&B, it will look something like this:

.. image:: images/multi_bnb.png
   :width: 700 px
   :align: center

A hotel might look more like this:

   :align: center

When you have finished adding your room types (don't worry, you can always add more later), click on 'Create property and add details' - this will create your property and direct you to the property management interface: `Manage Properties`_


Manage Properties

Every property has five tabs:

1. `View`_

Manage Availability
-------------------

To manage the availability of your property, click on the 'Manage Availability' tab.  This page will look much the same for a single unit property and a multi unit property, but both are managed the same way.

A single unit property has only one unit to manage.

.. image:: images/locanda_avail.png
   :width: 700 px
   :align: center

Multi unit properties show all units in the same place.

The default status of a unit is indicated by the background color. A light red indicates the unit is unavailable by default, whereas a light green background indicates the the unit is available.  To change the default availability for a type and its unit(s), see `Default Availability`_.

To override the default availability, select a date or range of dates for the unit. (To select a range of dates click and drag the dates you wish to update.) You will be given three choices: Make Available, Make Unavailable, and Create Booking.

A Property will either have a House (single unit property) or multiple Rooms (multi-unit property) associated with it.  To manage the Rooms of your multi unit property, click on the 'Manage Rooms' tab.

.. image:: images/rooms_edit.png
   :width: 700 px
   :align: center

In this tab, you can:
   Add additional types (using the same interface with which you added a property), by clicking on the 'add type' button.

   Edit the name of the Unit(s) of a type, by clicking on the 'Units' link for the type you wish to update, and then again on 'Edit Unit'. Update the name, and click 'Save Unit'.  The 'Edit' tab will take you to the editing interface for the Room type that unit belongs to, or you can click on the 'Back to Property' tab to return to your property.



Manage House

A Property will either have a House (single unit property) or multiple Rooms (multi-unit property) associated with it.  To manage the House of your single unit property, click on the 'House' tab.

Next, click on 'edit', next to your house name. (Should generally be the same as the name of your property, but this is not required).

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. `Type Description`_
2. `Add-Ons`_
3. `Default Availability`_
4. `Image`_
5. `Amenities`_

.. image:: images/type_description.png
   :width: 700 px
   :align: center

This tab contains the basic information about the house or room type.  Specify the maximum number of people that can be accommodated, the number of single beds (twin/bunks), the number of double beds (full/queen/king), number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms.

The Description field allows you to describe this room type, and will be displayed in a tooltip on the property page.

Add-Ons
~~~~~~~

.. image:: images/type_addons.png
   :width: 700 px
   :align: center

Property Add-Ons allow guests to tailor their experience at your property, and may be configured to raise, lower or replace the price, per stay or per night. They are highly flexible, and there is no limit to the number of add-ons you may offer your guests. If made mandatory, they will be automatically added to a booking, and required for check out - this is useful for configuring per-stay charges such as a cleaning fee.

To charge a mandatory cleaning fee of $35 per stay, we would add an add-on configured as follows:

Name: Cleaning fee

Quantity: 1

Operation: 'Add to price' will add the fee per stay, as opposed to per night.

Value: $35

Type: Mandatory

.. image:: images/cleaning_fee.png
   :width: 700 px
   :align: center

To offer roll-away beds for $20 per night, click the 'Add another item' button and configure the new add-on as follows:

Name: Roll-away bed

Quantity: 2 (This will allow guests to request up to 2 beds)

Operation: 'Add to price per night'

Value: $20

Type: Optional

.. image:: images/roll_away.png
   :width: 700 px
   :align: center

To allow guests to request a crib which costs $50 per stay, but may or may not be available, click the 'Add another item' button and configure the new add-on as follows:

Name: Crib

Quantity: 1

Operation: 'Add to price'

Value: $50

Type: On Request - the add-on's price will be displayed, but not added to the total. You will be responsible for collecting the additional fee at check-in if the add-on is available.

.. image:: images/crib.png

Default Availability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: images/type_avail.png
   :width: 700 px
   :align: center

The default availability field allows you to quickly make all units of a room type not available, by changing the field value to 'Not Available'.  Conversely, if you have made a type not available, and want to change it back to available again, change the field value to 'Available'.  You will see these changes reflected in the 'Manage Availability' tab of your property.

If the amenity you are looking for is not in the list, type the name (such as 'High Speed Internet'). A box will appear with the text: 'The term 'High Speed Internet' will be added', click on the box to create the amenity and add it to your property.
