Create New Content
******************

Your Roomify site is built on top of a powerful CMS called Drupal.  This means that in addition to being able to list properties and take bookings, you also have the ability to create an extensive blog, add local attractions (activities), create Locations, and create Landing Pages to feature components of your site. To add new content, open the 'Manage Content' tab of your dashboard, click on 'Add new content', and select one of the following types of content to add:

#. `Activity`_
#. `Blog Post`_
#. `Landing Page`_
#. `Location`_

Activity
========

Create activities to describe to guests what they can do in and around your property. Activities can also show up on the map if you give them an address and co-ordinates. This is a great way to help guests imagine how great a stay at your property could be.

All of your activities will be displayed on a page that is accessed by the 'Activities' link in your menu.  If you will not be using this feature, and wish to disable the link, do this by updating the menu (:ref:`roomify_accommodations_content_menu`).  Activities can be filtered by type, and clicked on to view more information.

Location Tab

You can display a map on the activity by setting the location. The address is optional.  If you fill this in, it will be shown in a tooltip when the marker is clicked on.  To set the marker location, use the Map Coordinates.  The coordinates can be set in two ways:

#. Enter an address in the 'Geocode Address' field.  Click on 'Find marker' (under the map). Once the marker position has been moved, click on 'Place marker here' and confirm.
#. Drag the marker to the correct location on the map. Click on 'Find marker' (under the map). Once the marker position has been moved, click on 'Place marker here' and confirm.

Here is an example of an activity with the geo location set and an address filled out.

Landing Page
============

Landing pages are an extremely flexible way to highlight content on your site.  Because they are so flexible, they can be a bit daunting at first glance, so we will step through a few examples. Begin by creating a new landing page: Dashboard -> Manage Content -> Add new content -> Landing Page

Give your landing page a title. The 'Is edge to edge' option determines whether the content is padded on the sides or not.  Experiment with this to see which way you like it better!

   :align: center

Now we will add some content to our page.  You will have the option to add a 1, 2, 3, or 4 column Row, or the 'Latest Blog Posts' widget. A row is a horizontal section of the page.  The number of columns in the row determines how many elements can be added to the row. You will see examples of this as we add content to our page.

+ `Featured Properties`_
+ `Featured Area`_
+ `Featured Area Type`_


Featured Properties
+++++++++++++++++++

In this example, we will feature two properties on our site. One called 'Locanda Vivaldi', and one called 'Casa Azzurra'. Because we will have two properties, we will select a 2 column row, each property will go in a column. 
1. Click on 'Add 2-Column Row'
2. Click on 'Edit 2-Column Row'
3. Row Title - If you want this row to have a title, add one, otherwise you can leave it blank. For our example, this row is titled 'Featured Properties'
4. Row View - Again, you can decide if you want the content to be edge to edge.  If you are using a background, you will probably want edge to edge.
5. Row Background - You can select a color, or add an image.  For this row, the background has been left blank.
6. First Element - Each column will contain an element. To feature a property, select 'Property' from the drop down list, and click 'Add new element'
7. Start typing the name of the property you wish to feature, and select it from the autocomplete - the first property in our example is 'Casa Azzurra'
8. Second Element - click on the 'second element' tab, and repeat the steps - select 'Property', click 'Add new element', and type in the name of the second property you wish to feature (in this case, 'Locanda Vivaldi')
9. Click 'Save and Close' - the modal window will close
10. IMPORTANT! - Click on the green 'Save' button at the bottom of the page, you should now see your new landing page, with two featured properties!
