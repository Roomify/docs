Title
=====

The title is only used within the site, on administrative pages.

Subject
=======

See: `Body`_

Body
====

You can use certain tokens in the Subject and the Body of your emails, that will be replaced with the information relevant to the action that triggered the email. The tokens available are listed beneath the Body field. There are a few tokens that are available to all emails - site name, site url, and the site login url.

An example of how a token works:

Your sites' url is "mysite.roomify.me".  You would like the subject line of the order confirmation email to read "Thank you for making a booking at mysite.roomify.me"

The Subject field in the template should be: Thank you for making a booking at [site:url]
