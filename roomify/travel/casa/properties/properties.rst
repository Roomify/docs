+ `Single Unit Property`_

	A single unit property is a property that can only be booked as a whole. The most common type of single unit property is a Vacation Rental.  The rental property may have 1, 2, or even 12 bedrooms, but a booking is made for the whole property.

+ `Multi Unit Property`_


	A multi unit property is a property with multiple individually bookable rooms. Both B & B's and Hotels are multi unit properties.

Single Unit Property
--------------------
To create a single unit property, enter the name of the property, select 'Single Unit (Entire Home)', and click 'next'. You will then be asked to define the maximum number of occupants, and the default nightly rate:
