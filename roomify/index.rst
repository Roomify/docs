Roomify Platform
================
The *Roomify Platform* is the next-generation solution for online booking and availability management from Roomify. It is built on top of our unique, open-source, Booking and Availability Management framework: :ref:`BAT <BAT>`.

The Roomify Platform allows users to manage availability, pricing and booking, within a single platform, for a multiple range of scenarios.

Our first product is Roomify for Accommodations - it can scale from a single vacation rental website with channel management to full multi-property / multi-owner for vacation rentals, hotels and B&Bs. It is available as cloud hosting or self-hosted - `get pricing details and access to demo here <https://roomify.us/travel-booking-solutions>`_.
