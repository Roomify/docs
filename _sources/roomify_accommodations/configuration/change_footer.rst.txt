The **Change Footer Text** option is listed under the Manage Configuration Tab of your dashboard. This customization option allows you to place your site name, year, and copyright into the footer of your webpage. It also allows you to add any other relevant information, such as your address, or phone number, if you want those easily visible to users.

To modify your footer text, simply type the content you are wishing to display into the **Footer** field, and click **Save configuration**. Your new text will automatically update on your webpage once it has been saved.
