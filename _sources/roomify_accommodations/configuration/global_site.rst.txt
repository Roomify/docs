Global Site Settings
********************

Global Site Settings, located under the Manage Configurations tab of your dashboard, allows you to edit the information that will show up when your site is accessed. The first field, site name, will appear on your header tab when users access your site. The front page settings allow you to select which landing page will be used as your default front page.

The Logo image settings allows you to choose between displaying your site name or site logo. If you prefer using a logo, simply uncheck the box, and upload your logo image.

The last option, Shortcut icon settings, allows you choose between the default icon that comes with the theme, and uploading your own icon image. If you wish to use your own icon image, simply uncheck the box and upload your new icon image.

Once your global options have been selected, remember to click **Save configuration**.
