Bookings
********

Bookings is where we hold information about guests that are coming to the accommodation. 

Bookings are either created automatically by a potential guest through the checkout out process or can be created manually via the admin pages. 

The Booking creation page provides full access to the various options and allows you to perform an availability search, it also allow you to create customer profiles and it will automatically create a Commerce Order.
